This synthesizer design builds on [zynthian](http://zynthian.org/), building on its 3D printed case design, with the following modifications:

- Re-modeled the case in FreeCad (instead of sketchup)
- Internalized mounting holes for the top frame, so they aren't visible
- Increased case size to allow for 2x18650 lithium batteries, and charge + power circuitry
- Changed top panel to allow for my Waveshare 32B clone TFT screen
- Added holes for 2x headphone jack
